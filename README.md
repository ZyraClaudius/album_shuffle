# Album Shuffle

## Overview
This is a web app I created to connect to the user's Spotify account, retrieve their saved albums, and allow them to play a random one.
### Update
The app now allows the user to choose to shuffle their playlists or search for an artist to shuffle albums by them.

## This repository
I used create-react-app for this project, which takes care of some template code and installing React modules. For this reason, I have only included here the code which I wrote, some React components (nothing exists on the user's screen outside of these) and a Spotify.js module I wrote to handle connecting to Spotify and handling the album list. I also include the CSS stylesheets associated with the project.

## Access 
The app is available to use <a href="http://albumshuffle.surge.sh">here</a> but Spotify only allows 25 named users to verify with their accounts. If you'd like to be on the list of named users then please email me your name and <b>the email address registered to your Spotify account</b> at zyraclaudius@hotmail.com. I am happy to give access to anyone, and if it gets full then I may apply to Spotify for increased scope.
